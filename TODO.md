# TODO

- Add key bindings to the footer
- add checkboxes for uvicorn options ie '--reload'
- show the current process command line at the bottom under the logs
- allow saving the log to a file. Ask for a file name, suggesting the current
  process name and the current date and time for example.
- improve the RichLog to colourize the log lines
- set focus to the log after each button pressed as the button active highling
  bugs me. **That would not be great for accessibility though**.
- maybe move the server status to the footer.
