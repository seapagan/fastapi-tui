# Fastapi Tui <!-- omit in toc -->

This is a work in progress to see how to use
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) and
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) together, and to see if it's possible
to create a TUI application that can communicate with a FastAPI server.

Right now there is no usable code here, but I'm working on it.
